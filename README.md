# Final Project : Telcos Churn Prediction
This project was conducted by a group of students from COMS 4995: Applied Machine Learning at Columbia University.

# Project Description
This project focuses on churn detection by leveraging datasets from a telco to identify early indicators of churn. Using predictive modeling, we aim to pinpoint high-value, at-risk customers early, enabling the implementation of targeted strategies to reduce churn and improve retention. 

Such predictive models we used were baseline decision trees with Random Oversampling & Smote, Random Forest, and XG Boost, which you can see and look at how we did so in the AML_Team_Project.ipynb file. To run our model predictive model code without any issues, ensure that all of the xlsx data files we provided are in the same directory along with the AML_Team_Project.ipynb file. Afterward, you can then just run the AML_Team_Project.ipynb file. 

With that, we would love any feedback or thoughts on whether alternative methods can be used to improve the predictive models we created.
