# Final Project : Telcos Churn Prediction
This project was conducted by a group of students from COMS 4995: Applied Machine Learning at Columbia University.

# Project Description
The project focuses on churn detection by leveraging datasets from a telco to identify early indicators of churn. Using predictive modeling, we aim to pinpoint high-value, at-risk customers early, enabling the implementation of targeted strategies to reduce churn and improve retention.

Such predictive models we used were baseline decision trees with Random Oversampling & Smote, Random Forest, and XG Boost, which you can see and look at how we did so in the AML_Team_Project.ipynb file. We would love any feedback or thoughts on whether there are alternative methods that can be used to improve the predictive models we created.
